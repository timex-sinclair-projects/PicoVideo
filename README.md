# PicoVideo
**This project is still in development, so caveat emptor!**

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to generate video for the TS2068. This project provides clearer video and some expanded video functionality.

We've discovered a small issue related to the faster speed PLDs in the production hardware. The fix is a [quick-and-easy upload of new firmware to your PicoVideo](https://github.com/timex-sinclair-projects/PicoVideo/tree/main/V4).
